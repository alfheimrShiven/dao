# Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) üèõÔ∏è

## About
In this project, I demonstrate the process involved in running a DAO. Below are the steps involved in executing a task through a DAO:

**Step 1:** Granting roles to participants using TimeLock contract.

**Step 2:** Making a proposal to the Governor.

**Step 3:** Voting takes place post the voting delay.

**Step 4:** Queuing the proposal post the voting period. This is done to allow the participants who were against the proposal to leave the DAO if they wish to.
 
**Step 5:** Execution of the proposal.
